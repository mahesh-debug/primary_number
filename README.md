    Note:
        prime Number:
            A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.
            A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 
            5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself
